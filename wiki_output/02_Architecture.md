## Architecture
### System Design and Architecture
The architecture of the LLM Token Analytics Library is designed to facilitate modularity and reusability. It consists of core components that interact seamlessly to provide a comprehensive analytics solution.

### Core Components and Their Interactions
- **API Server**: A Flask-based server that handles incoming requests for running simulations and data analysis.
- **Simulation Engine**: The core logic that executes various pricing simulations.
- **Data Collection Module**: Interfaces with LLM providers to gather usage data.
- **Visualization Module**: Generates visual representations of the simulation results and usage data.

### Technology Stack and Dependencies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for API server), Dash (for dashboard visualization)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Statistical Analysis**: SciPy, Statsmodels
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Databases**: Supports local file-based storage; can be extended for cloud storage

### Design Patterns Used
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates data handling, user interface, and application logic for cleaner code organization.
- **Singleton**: Used for managing API client instances to ensure a single point of access.
