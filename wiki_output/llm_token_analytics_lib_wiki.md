# LLM Token Analytics Library - Wiki Documentation

## Overview
The LLM Token Analytics Library is a robust Python library designed for analyzing Large Language Model (LLM) token usage patterns, retrieving provider data, and running comprehensive pricing simulations. This project serves as a valuable tool for developers, data scientists, and researchers who are interested in optimizing LLM usage costs and understanding usage dynamics.

### Primary Use Cases and Target Audience
- **Developers** looking to integrate LLM token analytics into their applications.
- **Data Scientists** seeking to analyze and visualize LLM token usage patterns.
- **Researchers** studying the economic implications of different pricing mechanisms for LLMs.

### Key Features and Capabilities
- Monte Carlo simulations for pricing mechanism comparisons.
- REST API client for remote simulation execution and data retrieval.
- Data collection from various LLM providers.
- Customizable pricing mechanisms and simulation configurations.
- Full end-to-end data collection and optimization workflows.

## Architecture
### System Design and Architecture
The architecture of the LLM Token Analytics Library is designed to facilitate modularity and reusability. It consists of core components that interact seamlessly to provide a comprehensive analytics solution.

### Core Components and Their Interactions
- **API Server**: A Flask-based server that handles incoming requests for running simulations and data analysis.
- **Simulation Engine**: The core logic that executes various pricing simulations.
- **Data Collection Module**: Interfaces with LLM providers to gather usage data.
- **Visualization Module**: Generates visual representations of the simulation results and usage data.

### Technology Stack and Dependencies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for API server), Dash (for dashboard visualization)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Statistical Analysis**: SciPy, Statsmodels
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Databases**: Supports local file-based storage; can be extended for cloud storage

### Design Patterns Used
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates data handling, user interface, and application logic for cleaner code organization.
- **Singleton**: Used for managing API client instances to ensure a single point of access.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **System Requirements**
  - Python 3.9 or higher
  - Basic understanding of Python and command-line usage

- **Required Software and Tools**
  - Python package manager (`pip`)
  - Virtual environment manager (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aanshshah/llm_token_analytics_lib.git
   cd llm_token_analytics_lib
   ```

2. Install the library and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. (Optional) Install provider dependencies for data collection:
   ```bash
   pip install llm-token-analytics[providers]
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables for API keys (if applicable):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project"
   ```

### Verification Steps
To verify the installation, run the basic simulation example:
```bash
python examples/01_basic_simulation.py
```

## Quick Start
### Basic Usage Example
To get started quickly, run the basic simulation:
```bash
python examples/01_basic_simulation.py
```

### Common Workflows
- **Running a Monte Carlo simulation**: Use `01_basic_simulation.py`.
- **Interacting with the API**: Start the API server and then run `02_api_client.py`.
- **Collecting usage data**: Ensure API keys are set and run `03_data_collection.py`.

## Usage Guide
### Detailed Usage Instructions
Each example script demonstrates a specific functionality:
- **Basic Simulation**: Run the script to see how different pricing mechanisms perform.
- **API Client**: Interacts with the API for remote simulations and retrieves results.
- **Data Collection**: Gathers real-time usage data from LLM providers.

### Command-Line Interface
- Each script can be executed directly via the command line.
- Arguments and configurations can be adjusted within the scripts for different scenarios.

### Configuration Options
Configuration files, such as `.env` and `config.yaml`, can be used to set environment variables and application settings.

### Examples for Common Scenarios
Refer to the `examples/` directory for practical scripts demonstrating common use cases.
