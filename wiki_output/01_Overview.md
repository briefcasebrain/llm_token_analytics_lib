## Overview
The LLM Token Analytics Library is a robust Python library designed for analyzing Large Language Model (LLM) token usage patterns, retrieving provider data, and running comprehensive pricing simulations. This project serves as a valuable tool for developers, data scientists, and researchers who are interested in optimizing LLM usage costs and understanding usage dynamics.

### Primary Use Cases and Target Audience
- **Developers** looking to integrate LLM token analytics into their applications.
- **Data Scientists** seeking to analyze and visualize LLM token usage patterns.
- **Researchers** studying the economic implications of different pricing mechanisms for LLMs.

### Key Features and Capabilities
- Monte Carlo simulations for pricing mechanism comparisons.
- REST API client for remote simulation execution and data retrieval.
- Data collection from various LLM providers.
- Customizable pricing mechanisms and simulation configurations.
- Full end-to-end data collection and optimization workflows.
